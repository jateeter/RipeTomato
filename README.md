A comprehensive shelter management system featuring **unified individual data ownership** through HAT (Hub of All Things) personal data vaults and Apple Wallet digital access representations.

## üè† Overview

This system revolutionizes shelter management by putting data ownership and privacy control directly into the hands of the individuals being served. Each client receives their own personal data vault and digital wallet access, ensuring maximum privacy, security, and autonomy.

## üîê Unified Data Ownership Model

### Core Principles

- **Individual Data Ownership**: Each client owns and controls their personal data
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Service providers cannot access raw personal data
- **Data Portability**: Complete control over data sharing and transfer
- **Digital Wallet Integration**: Seamless access through Apple Wallet passes
- **Compliance by Design**: Built-in GDPR and privacy regulation compliance

### Architecture Components

1. **HAT (Hub of All Things) Data Vaults**
   - Personal data microserver for each individual
   - Zero-knowledge encrypted storage
   - Full data portability and interoperability
   - Programmable privacy controls

2. **Apple Wallet Digital Passes**
   - Shelter access passes for services and facilities
   - Health credential passes for emergency information
   - Identification passes for official documentation
   - Service entitlement passes for program access
   - Emergency contact passes for critical situations

3. **Unified Service Interface**
   - Seamless integration between HAT vaults and wallet passes
   - Cross-system data synchronization
   - Comprehensive audit logging
   - Data integrity validation

## üåü Project Vision

This system represents a new paradigm in social services technology - one where individual privacy, data ownership, and personal autonomy are built into the foundation rather than added as an afterthought. By giving each person complete control over their personal data while still enabling effective service delivery, we can build more ethical, empowering, and effective support systems.
