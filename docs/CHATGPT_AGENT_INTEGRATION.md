## Technical Integration

### BotLab Core Integration

ChatGPT agents work alongside other bot types:

```typescript
import { chatGPTBotIntegration } from './integrations/ChatGPTBotIntegration';

// Create ChatGPT bot
const bot = await chatGPTBotIntegration.createBot(
  'Intake Assistant',
  'client-intake'
);

// Send message
const response = await chatGPTBotIntegration.sendMessage(
  bot.botId,
  'Client is first-time homeless with children'
);

console.log(response); // AI-generated guidance
```

### Function Calling

Agents can call system functions for real-time data:

```typescript
// Agent calls function
{
  name: 'get_service_availability',
  arguments: {
    serviceType: 'shelter',
    location: 'downtown'
  }
}

// System responds with actual data
{
  available: true,
  currentCapacity: '15 beds available',
  nextAvailability: 'Now'
}
```

### Conversation Management

```typescript
// Start new conversation
const conversationId = await chatGPTAgentService.startConversation('service-recommender');

// Send messages
const response1 = await chatGPTAgentService.sendMessage(conversationId, 'First message');
const response2 = await chatGPTAgentService.sendMessage(conversationId, 'Follow-up');

// Get history
const conversation = chatGPTAgentService.getConversation(conversationId);

// Clear when done
chatGPTAgentService.clearConversation(conversationId);
```

- Policies and procedures change - check current protocols
- Test responses with supervisor before implementing recommendations

---

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Responding

**Check:**
1. API key configured in `.env.local`
2. Internet connection active
3. OpenAI API status (https://status.openai.com)
4. Usage limits not exceeded

**Solutions:**
- Verify API key is correct (starts with `sk-`)
- Check OpenAI account for billing issues
- Try different agent
- Use mock responses (available when API offline)

### Unexpected Responses

**If agent provides inappropriate or unhelpful responses:**
1. Rephrase your question with more context
2. Ask agent to clarify or provide more details
3. Start new conversation (clears previous context)
4. Report issue to supervisor
5. Use different agent for that need

### Cost Concerns

**Monitor usage:**
- OpenAI dashboard shows token consumption
- Set monthly spending limits
- Use GPT-3.5-turbo for simple questions
- Implement conversation timeouts

**Reduce costs:**
- Clear old conversations regularly
- Be concise in messages
- Use for complex questions only
- Cache common responses locally
